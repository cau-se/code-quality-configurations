# Code Quality Styles & Configuration Files

This repository aims for providing coding style guides. In contrast to other guidelines, we try to not set up new, own rules,
but instead summarize existing ones that are established in their respective communities. Furthermore, we unite simple layout and code formatting rules with established best practises.

Moreover, we provide configuration files and instructions to automcatically check code according to these styles during development and in the build process. The suggested rules and checks should only be a starting point for custom, project-specific ones.
